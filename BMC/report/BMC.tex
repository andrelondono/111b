\section{Apparatus and Procedure}\label{sec:ap}
In this experiment we use an inverted compound microscope that is connected to a CCD camera where the image processing is done by a given particle tracking script.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  We adjust our condenser irises and depth of field to achieve Kohler Illumination to control the amount of light and the incident angle that the light shines on the sample. This setup ensures that the image of the light source is not superposed onto the actual image of the specimen and provides uniform illumination and heating to the sample.  
\item  Then we adjust the condenser so that so that all the illuminating light is blocked off and we only see the light that scatters off the specimen. This technique is called darkfield  illumination and it enables us to look at small particles ($\leq1\mu m$ with the 40x objective) that would otherwise be hard to see with direct illumination.
\item To calibrate the microscope, we make a solution of 10$\mu$m microbeads and water to obtain a pixel-to-meters ratio used in the image-processing script. known size

%Apparatus and Procedure: You should have enough detail so that one familiar with physics but not with the particular experiment at hand could reproduce your experiment if necessary. A block diagram of the equipment is essential here—this should be your own, and not copied out of a book or lab manual. Explain the major pieces of equipment and what they do, but do not overwhelm your reader with details here!
\section{Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}
%Analysis:  the calculations that the lab manual asks you to do are supposed to act as a guide to your analysis, and not as a series of separate calculations. agree with prediction? error analysis? source of error, uncertainty?

%Raw Data: You must include the data that you took in lab in an appendix; the data should be clear enough so that someone could look at it and determine what you measured and how you measured it. You should be keeping a lab notebook, so simply photocopy all relevant pages. Your report should include all of the listed sections, along with the signed Pre-lab and Mid–Lab Discussion sheets.
